<h1>Word Clouds - Objects Identified by Gender</h1>

<p>The word clouds show a visual representation of the frequency of objects posted by each of the 4 gender response categories. 
    Words that appear larger in the image appeared in higher frequency in the objects identified column. 
    We expect that users of different genders would post different images due to differences in interests we noted in a previous assignment.
     While we do see male users to be posting images containing more sports related content — soccer, jersey, basketball, volleyball, ball, soccer — we do still see great similarity in objects identified in photos posted. Regardless of gender, objects such as jacket, book, website, comic, and dust are consistently some of the more frequently identified objects.
