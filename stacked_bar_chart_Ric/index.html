    <p> The Normalized Stacked Bar Chart illustrates the relative frequency of the top 15 interests on Pixstory, segmented by age groups. This visualization was selected to provide insights into the correlation between user age and their predilection for specific content categories. Since the majority of Pixstory users are young adults - by normalizing the data, we were able to place the emphasis on the distribution across age groups rather than the absolute volume of users.</p>
